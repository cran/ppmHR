Description: An implementation of the one-step privacy-protecting method for estimating the overall and site-specific hazard ratios using inverse probability weighted Cox models in distributed data network studies, as proposed by Shu, Yoshida, Fireman, and Toh (2019) <doi: 10.1177/0962280219869742>. This method only requires sharing of summary-level riskset tables instead of individual-level data. Both the conventional inverse probability weights and the stabilized weights are implemented.
